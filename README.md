# 🛍️ Sales Prediction with Python

A machine learning project to predict sales using historical data, built with Python. This project demonstrates the use of data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation techniques to forecast sales for a retail store.

---

## 📈 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can estimate future sales based on historical data. It involves:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Training various regression models
- Evaluating model performance
- Visualizing predictions

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **NumPy** for numerical operations
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning models and evaluation
- (Optional) **XGBoost / LightGBM** for advanced regression models
- **Jupyter Notebook** for experimentation
